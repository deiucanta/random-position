---

When working with ordered sequences and you need to provide a sortable list, you'll find that working with positions is challenging.

- you want to make as few changes as possible to your data and not to update every record with their new possition
- you want your positions to be as short as possible to not waste memory
- you want to be able to add real-time capabilities to allow multiple collaborators to work at the same time
- you want a lock-free and eventually consistent experience

This tool is inspired by two nice close-source implementations. You can find some information about them here

1. Figma's ordered sequences (https://blog.figma.com/realtime-editing-of-ordered-sequences-c1e6b46fcd67)
2. Flip's ordered containers (https://youtu.be/W0kQ1um9X6w?t=7m1s)

Go ahead an read/watch the resources above. It'll take 15 minutes but it's worth the time.

On top of the ideas from Figma and Flip this library implements a random generator that gives you the shortest possible position string.

## Installation

```bash
npm install random-position --save
```

## Example

```js
var RandomPosition = require('random-position')

RandomPosition.between('1', '4')
RandomPosition.between('595', '601')

RandomPosition.after('98723412')
RandomPosition.before('98723412')
```

## Todo

- [ ] add mocha
- [ ] add examples (react + firebase)
